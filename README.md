# Implemenetations

[iota-python for Python and Micropython](https://github.com/blanu/iota-python)

# Utilities

[iota-wrapper for generating iota wrappers for Arduino C++ libraries](https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/iota-wrapper)

# iota-kotlin

iota-kotlin is a cross-platform implementation of the iota programming language for Kotlin/Android.
In the current implementation, no instructions are implemented in Kotlin. Instead, iota-cpp is called on an Arduino via RPC.
This allows Android applications written in Kotlin to drive Arduinos remotely by sending iota programs.
